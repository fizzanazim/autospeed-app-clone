This is a full-stack MERN e-commerce app where I've handled everything from front-end development to <br> server-side logic — including JWT-based login systems, role-based access control (RBAC),<br> Stripe payment gateway integration, and Cloudinary for image uploads.

I structured my projects using the MVC pattern, added custom middlewares for route protection, <br>and worked with MongoDB for data handling.
