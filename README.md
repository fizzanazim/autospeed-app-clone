This is a full-stack MERN e-commerce app where I've handled everything from front-end development to server-side logic â€” including JWT-based login systems, role-based access control (RBAC), Stripe payment gateway integration, and Cloudinary for image uploads.

I structured my projects using the MVC pattern, added custom middlewares for route protection, and worked with MongoDB for data handling.
